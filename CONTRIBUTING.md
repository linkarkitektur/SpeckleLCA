# 🌟 Contribution Guidelines for SpeckLCA 🌟

Hey there! 👋 We're super excited that you're interested in contributing to our project!

Whether you're fixing bugs 🐛, adding features ✨, or improving documentation 📚, your help is invaluable.

Let's make this project awesome together!

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before you dive in, make sure you're familiar with:

- JavaScript and Vue3 (essential for frontend tweaks)
- Firebase and Google Cloud Platform (for backend magic)
- Vite for build optimization (so everything runs smooth)
- Git & GitHub (for all the version control shenanigans)

## Setting Up the Project Locally 🏠

**Clone the Repo**: Fork and clone the repo to your local machine.

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/linkarkitektur/SpeckleLCA.git
```

**Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies.

```sh
  npm i
```

**Environment Setup**: Set up your .env file with the required Firebase and GCP credentials. (Don't worry, we've got a template for you! 📄)

## Making Contributions 🚀

1. **Pick an Issue**: Check out the 'Issues' tab and pick something you're excited about.

2. **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for your work. Here is a general convention that keep things clean (including capitalisation):

   ```sh
     git checkout -b dev-[your-name]-[feature]
   ```

   For example:

   ```sh
     git checkout -b dev-ryan-add-searchbar
   ```

3. **Code Away**: Make your changes, keeping our [coding style](./CODESTYLE.md) in mind. Remember, _clean and readable code_ is the way to go! ✨ 🧹

4. **Test Your Changes**: Make sure everything works as expected and write tests if necessary.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Write meaningful commit messages that explain your changes.

   ```sh
     git commit -m "Added a cool new feature"
   ```

6. **Push and Pull Request**: Push your changes and create a pull request. Describe what you've done and how it impacts the project.
7. **Wait for Review**: Our team will review your PR. We might have some questions or suggestions, so keep an eye out! 👀

## Code of Conduct 🤝

We're committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment. Be respectful, patient, and kind to each other. Any form of harassment or toxic behavior won't be tolerated. Let's keep it positive and fun!
